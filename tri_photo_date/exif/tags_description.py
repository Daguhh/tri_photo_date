Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count.

    "Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin": "Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.",
    "Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize": "Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image.

This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.",
    "Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2": "CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order.

This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.",
    "Exif.Image.AnalogBalance": "Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.",
    "Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral": "Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.",
    "Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY": "Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.",
    "Exif.Image.BaselineExposure": "Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.",
    "Exif.Image.BaselineNoise": "Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.",
    "Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness": "Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.",
    "Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit": "Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).",
    "Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit": "Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.",
    "Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber": "CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.",
    "Exif.Image.LensInfo": "Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.",
    "Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius": "ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.",
    "Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength": "Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).",
    "Exif.Image.ShadowScale": "This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.",
    "Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData": "Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.",
    "Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety": "MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.",
    "Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1": "The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1).
