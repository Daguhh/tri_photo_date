Functionnalities:
- Permit to stop process and start it again (maybe add a bool column in images table for processed files) : show a popup at start : "do you want to continue your processing or drop it all?"
- add tab to set custom tag
- create folder/filter following pattern ie: move only images like "IMG_XXXX-XX-XX.jpg" 
- save/load a config file (cli & gui) to make custom profiles
- permit to custom presets
- partial hash big files
- skip files based on their size more or less than X
- remove empty folders after moving

CLI:
- permit to load multiple script : a sequence could be to create multiple script to handle differents camera (with differents camera filters) and save them, so next time :
```bash
tri_photo_date -l camera_1.ini, camera_2.ini
```
Do the same in gui?
```
=> configure => save script => select scripts to run
    |             |
    ^-------------<
```

Code bugs and major lacks:
- command for package install (poetry)
- program doesn't compare dates of destination folder

Duplicates:
- more control over duplicates : just rename / move in specific folder
- replace hash option by : check only name/check file/check image datas + check destination folder
- permit to preserve structure and only filter duplicate?? Is it really a good idea?

Increase process speed:
- add button to skip metadatas?

Misc:
- move requirement to a specific file to permit installs with pip
- add changelog
- Better handle version number : automatic naming package? version file?
