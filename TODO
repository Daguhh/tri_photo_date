Functionnalities:
- add tab to set custom tag
- create folder/filter following pattern ie: move only images like "IMG_XXXX-XX-XX.jpg" 
- save/load a config file (cli & gui) to make custom profiles
- permit to custom presets
- option to delet metadata from exported files

Code bugs and major lacks:
- cli
- command for package install (poetry)

Duplicates:
- more control over duplicates : just rename / move in specific folder
- replace hash option by : check only name/check file/check image datas + check destination folder
- permit to preserve structure and only filter duplicate?? Is it really a good idea?

Increase process speed:
- add button to skip metadatas?
- update database instead of erasing? => split image table into image_cache (cache fingerprints, metadatas...) and images (simple list of actual images to process) => add a button to erase, do it each time? clean up old files function?

Misc:
- move requirement to a specific file to permit installs with pip
- add changelog
- Better handle version number : automatic naming package? version file?
