Functionnalities:
- Permit to stop process and start it again (maybe add a bool column in images table for processed files) : show a popup at start : "do you want to continue your processing or drop it all?"
- add tab to set custom tag
- save/load a config file (cli & gui) to make custom profiles => almost done for cli
- permit to custom presets
- remove empty folders after moving

CLI:
- permit to load multiple script : a sequence could be to create multiple script to handle differents camera (with differents camera filters) and save them, so next time :
    ```bash
    tri_photo_date -l camera_1.ini, camera_2.ini
    ```
    Do the same in gui?
    ```
    => configure => save script => select scripts to run
        |             |
        ^-------------<
    ```

Code bugs and major lacks:
- program doesn't compare dates of destination folder

Duplicates:
- more control over duplicates : just rename / move in specific folder
- check only name option
- permit to preserve structure and only filter duplicate?? Is it really a good idea?

Misc:
- add changelog
- Better handle version number : automatic naming package? version file?
